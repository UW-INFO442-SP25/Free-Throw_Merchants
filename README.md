## 📌 Problem Statement

### 🎯 United Nations SDG Focus
**Primary SDG:**  
**Goal 2 – Zero Hunger**  
*“End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.”*

---

### ❓ How Might We...
> **How might we connect businesses with excess food to food-insecure individuals so that we can reduce waste while improving access to nutrition?**

---

### 🧠 Problem Understanding

Based on research from [UN.org](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/) and additional academic sources, the key contributors to hunger and food insecurity include:

- Lack of investment in agriculture
- Weak social protection programs
- Inefficient or unsustainable food systems
- Lack of support for local farmers and markets
- Food waste
- Uninformed food choices

Additional findings from literature:
- Five key risk factors increasing food insecurity are:  
  **low education, weak social networks, low social capital, low income, and unemployment**  
  *(Smith et al., 2017)*  
- Food security is defined as:  
  > *"When all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life."*  
  *(FAO, 2009)*

From the Green Restaurant Association:
- **84.3%** of unused food in U.S. restaurants is thrown away
- Only **14%** is recycled and **1.4%** donated  
- A single restaurant can generate **25,000–75,000 pounds** of food waste annually

### ✅ Problem Scope: What We're Tackling

- **Food waste from restaurants and businesses**
