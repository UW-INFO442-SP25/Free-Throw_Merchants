            <h2> The Problem </h2>
            <p>
                According to Fourth NOAM, "In the US, around 84.3% of unused food in restaurants is thrown away while only 1.4% is donated" (Mettler, 2023). Restaurants can produce "up to 25000-75000 pounds of food waste a year" (Green Restaurant Association). Meanwhile, the UN reports that "approximately 735 million people – 9.2% of the world's population – found themselves in a state of chronic hunger in 2022" (UN SDG).

            <h2> Our Mission </h2>
            <p>
                FoodSaver connects U-District businesses with excess food to individuals who need it most. We aim to reduce waste while improving access to nutrition through a simple, dignified platform.
            </p>

            <h2> Simple Process </h2>
            <p>
                Businesses can quickly list available food, while community members browse and claim these donations easily. Our design removes barriers and creates connections that benefit everyone.
            </p>

            <h2> Take Action Today </h2>
            <p>
                Whether you're a business with excess food or someone seeking nutritional support, join us in creating a community where food nourishes people, not landfills. As the UN suggests, fight food waste "at home, at work and in the community" (UN SDG).
            </p>
